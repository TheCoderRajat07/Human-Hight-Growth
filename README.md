# Human-Hight-Growth
This project is a single-page interactive web application that transforms a comprehensive scientific report on human height into an engaging and easily digestible educational experience. The application breaks down the complex science behind what determines our stature into five key pillars: Genetics, Physiology, Hormones, Nutrition, and Lifestyle.
